# Mexico City is home to just over 150 museums

The list includes museums with `history`, `science`, `art`, `culture`, `fun` to be enjoyed.

Most of them are museums related to Mexican culture, but let's not forget that we are a big city,
so there are also works by world-class artists like Andy Warhol in temporary exhibitions.

      Context and history. The museum opened almost half a century ago on Reforma Avenue, but this museum
      was found in different locations in the city, housing works and relics from the beginning of man

      to a more contemporary Mexico. It is one of the most important museums in the world not only for

      Context and history. The palace was built by order of former president Porfirio Díaz, who wanted
      to represent the centenary of Mexico's independence. The architect who initially dedicated himself
      to the construction was the Italian Adamo Boari who followed the currents of Art Nouveau. The plan
      of the palace is said to be based on the Aztec god of rain, Tlaloc. The building was delayed due
      to all the problems of the Mexican revolution, but it ended in 1934, opening with a series of murals
      by Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, among other artists.{' '}

    <li type="square"> You will find inside. </li>- A) Permanet exhibition. The frescos that show the
    background and culture of Mexico, criticism of the government, science and technology, and where
    Mexican and world society is, and where we are headed. It is worth emphasizing that there is a dichotomy
    between two murals, "The Man in Control of the Universe" and "Katharsis", one telling us that man
    will dominate the machines and the other that the machines will dominate us. Who will be right? In
    the future I will launch a book that will explain this. - B) Temporal exhibitions. The exhibitions
    are mostly national, being works that are touring abroad, or international art exhibitions.

      Context and history. In a similar way to Carlos Slim, Eugenio López Alonso opens to the public
      the works to which he had access, in his juice factory located in Ecatepec, on the outskirts of
      the City, and because of the distance, he builds this enclosure in front of the Soumaya Museum
      to make it available to the public. Both museums are quite young, just 9 and 16 years old. There
      are usually a lot of people, come early.{' '}

    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      You will find inside. All the exhibitions are temporary of abstract art, but in general they are
      very good, they have approaches that are not easy to identify. Lately, Mexican or Latin exhibitions
      have arrived, and the best thing is the view towards the Soumaya museum, for some extraordinary
      photos for Instagram.{' '}

      {' '}
      Context and history. To begin with, the museum is located in the Chapultepec forest, which is one
      of the largest green areas in Mexico City. The name comes from Nahuátl, which means grasshopper
      hill, that's why you will see a couple of sculptures denoting this insect. This is the only castle
      in America and it served as a fort for when the [child heroes](https://www.gob.mx/sedena/acciones-y-programas/ninos-heroes)
      died in battle when we suffered the invasion by the USA and they forced us to sell more than half
      of our territory. Similarly, when we suffered from the [French intervention](https://www.gob.mx/sedena/documentos/la-intervencion-francesa),
      Emperor Maximilian of Hapsburg together with his wife Carlota, they lived in the castle. In the
      period of Revolution and post-revolution, a couple of Presidents of Mexico lived, such as Porfirio
      Díaz and Plutarco Elías Calles. Soon you can realize that we have suffered many wars.{' '}
    </li>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      You will find inside. It is a very large museum, with many gardens and a beautiful view of Reforma
      Avenue, being able to see the angel of independence from here. I recommend that you go before or
      after noon because there are too many people.{' '}

      How to arrive. From Chapultepec subway station, walk for approximately 15 minutes.{' '}

      Context and history. It is a fairly young museum, with an origin in the Palace of Fine Arts, which
      designated the National Museum of Plastic Arts (which houses modern art). Seeing this, INBAL (the
      Institute of Fine Arts of Mexico) decided to create a museum in the city for this segment of art.{' '}
