     outside the Palace that will house the communications of the country. Opposite you will see what was the first engineering school in America, which years later was adopted by UNAM and currently belongs to the Faculty of Engineering of this Institution.

    You can see in the corner of the museum that when the construction was built, they tried to hide a snake head. When the Spaniards won the battle against the Aztecs, they demolished their atriums and built their churches or buildings on top of them, as a sign of the imposition of the Catholic religion.
    It should be noted that the ancient cultures of America were polytheistic, that is, they worshiped multiple gods, and that Jesus Christ was not found or figured. Almost opposite you can see a commemorative mural that represents the meeting of two cultures.</li>
    <li type="square"> You will find inside. </li>

  <summary>**Ruins of the main temple Museum** https://templomayor.inah.gob.mx/english : </summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square"> Context and history. In a similar way to the museum in Mexico City, the Spanish destroyed all of Tenochtitlan, and left these pyramids in ruins, imposing their cathedral that is located a few meters away. These ruins are one of the main vestiges that prove the existence of the Aztec empire, representing two of its greatest deities, the god of rain (Tlaloc) and the god of war (Huitzilopochtli).
    To one side of the ruins you will find a museum that extracted the main relics that have been found in the place. It has not yet been discovered. To make matters worse, they recently opened another part of the archaeological zone and you will find a dry tree, and if you are lucky that there are not many visitors, listen well next to the tree and you will perceive the sound of running water below.
    If you come to the city and it is open, it is the best thing you can do, because sometimes it closes because they continue with the excavation work.</li>
    <li type="square"> You will find inside. </li>

            - iii) [Tzompantli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzompantli). A series of skulls that are intertwined on a wall. These skulls represented the sacrifices they made to their gods on the esplanade of the enclosure. Once dead, they were stacked here.
            - iv) [Aztec calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_calendar). It was discovered next to [Coatlicue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C5%8D%C4%81tl%C4%ABcue) on the corner where Hernán Cortés lived (Palacio Nacional), it was discovered in this area but this one is in the [Museum of Anthropology and History](/blog/bestMuseums1)

The permanent exhibition is related to all the vestiges of the Aztec culture, mainly what was extracted from the ruins, but it also includes all their life, such as offerings, what their schools were like, the flora and fauna that surrounded them, as well as a couple of vestiges when they were conquered and carved in stone.
