# Day of the Dead tradition after Specter

## In the City a couple of events related to this mythical tradition were held

After the 007 Specter movie, the rituals grew. Throughout the most mythical neighborhoods and the center, the streets are decorated and
multiple events such as parades, night bike rides, representations of legends such as La Llorona, among other activities.

It could be said that due to this, and due to the large influx of foreign tourism, this tradition in Mexico City has become global, changing a couple of aspects of the tradition but preserving its essence.

  <summary>**Show of Dia de Muertos in chapultepec (October 28, 2022)**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square"> It is my favorite event of the day of the dead in the City. Similarly, the entrance is through
      the gate of the lions. You must go early because the lines are very long, preferably go one or
      two hours in advance. </li>

<details>
  <summary>**Recreation of La Llorona in Cuemanco (October 28, 2022)**:</summary>

    <li type="square"> I've never been but many people recommend it. It takes place on the trajineras of Xochimilco in
      the Cuemanco area, and it is an event that takes place at night so that the folklore and the darkness
      of this legend are felt more. </li>
    <li type="square"> It is a very complete representation of what happened just after the Spanish conquered us. If you
      want to know more about her, click [here](/blog/diaMuertos) </li>
