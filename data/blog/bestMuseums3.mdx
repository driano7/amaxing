      that happened in Mexico after having Porfirio Díaz in power for so many years, for which this armed
      conflict began due to the dissatisfaction of the Mexicans, in an internal war that happened in
      1910 to approximately 1921, so this museum shows that event and life in Mexico afterward. The museum
      is located in the monument to the revolution.
    </li>
    <li type="square"> You will find inside. </li>- A) Museum. The museum hardly has temporary exhibitions,
    but they are obviously related to this event, so sometimes you will see landscape paintings that

    flags, maps of everything related to the armed conflict. - B) Viewpoint. This is external to the

      {' '}
      Context and history. Initially, the museum was created to show the most representative paintings
      by Rufino Tamayo. Unlike Diego Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, he did not capture politics or nationalism,
      but rather Mexican traditions. Years ago I remember that many works by the painter were shown in
      this museum, now there are many temporary exhibitions of abstract art, but I have no doubt that
      they will return soon. Rufino was my countryman, we were born in the same state of Mexico.
