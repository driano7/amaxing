# Main objective

Amaxing was born with the purpose of making all the best of my Mexico known, inviting people from all over the world to learn and be part of our culture in different languages so that we can all understand each other and enjoy it to the fullest. Every day we do our best to achieve it.

# Abstract

The little contribution and dissemination by the Mexican government has not been an impediment to receive tourists from all over the world in large numbers. Our vast culture and charisma spreads all over the world and the country promotes itself only. Hand in hand with the new and drastic changes in technology and the Web, this opportunity can be taken advantage of so that tourists receive a better quality of services, during their stay and in their learning of the shelter of Mexico.

# Introduce

My name is Donovan Riaño, yes with ñ. Born in Ciudad Ixtepec, Oaxaca but living in Mexico City. He studied Computer Engineering at UNAM. A couple of months ago I had the opportunity to present my Bachelor's degree project at the Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. From there, I took a short vacation between Miami, Chicago and New York. I have done interviews for Meta (before Facebook) on twice but without success. I have carried out 4 projects throughout the university in collaboration with Doctor Guillermo Molero-Castillo related to the detection and blocking of ads on the Web, learning a lot about Marketing, Consumer Psychology, bad practices, tracking and second data analysis; flat, consumer profiling. Since I was a child I have been passionate about the history and mythology of Mexico, but it is not a very good life option since in Mexico it is not a very well-paid profession.

# Motivation

When I leave Mexico and get to know these big cities, like any foreign tourist, you compare the things you have in your country with those you don't; The city that I liked the most was Miami and NYC the least, but New York continues to be a standard City worldwide, so there are many well-established things.
When I was in the MoMA (Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York) there were too many people looking at Van Gogh's Starry Night, but the second painting that received the most visits was a self-portrait of `Frida Kahlo`, mostly by women, realizing that everything that we do not know how to value as Mexicans. Upon returning and going to a couple of museums in Mexico City I noticed the following:

    1. How bad are the infographics, which are not available in many museums in English, as well as the infographics that are in Spanish with a black background and white letters in some cases, with a lot of text. Mexicans in general are not used to reading, and being less uncomfortable, giving a bad user experience.
    2. It is a problem that tourists can move around Mexico City due to the costs of their data plans (from countries from Asia, Europe and South America).
    3. The terrible and little government intervention to promote and prepare information for tourists.
    4. There is a tourist police, but it is a small number of police officers who know how to speak English or another language, even in an interview with them, they use the translator.
    5. There is also a very strong phenomenon of gentrification in Mexico City, receiving a large number of people from all over the world who work remotely, mainly from the United States.
    6. In 2021, we were the second country in the world that received the most [foreign tourists](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/2022/02/23/mexico-el-segundo-pais-del-mundo-en-recibir-mas-turistas-internacionales-en-2021/), with a number of 31.9 million. When making visits to the main tourist spots in the city, I have observed this increase and how tourists fight with their cell phones about how to go to other places or with old brochures that are not updated.
    7. When reviewing the websites of different agencies, the national agencies only have information and tours for Mexicans, if you are a foreigner you must send them an email, being a terrible user experience again because what you want is to know the costs, schedules, and where you will go . If you are a foreigner, I agree that it is more expensive due to the power of the different currencies, but they inflate prices a lot. The foreign agencies are very complete, but they are expensive and they do not know precisely the history and well where the places are.

# Value proposal

To be the most complete, simple and specialized guide so that foreign tourists can go to Mexico safely and without complications. Currently offered:

<ol type="i">
  <li>
    {' '}
    Information on how to move by public transport without complications or how to get to a place.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    {' '}
    The hours, costs, the type of exhibitions you will find and if the establishments offer tours and
    infographics in English.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    {' '}
    Provide the necessary information and additional material in English so that tourists understand
    what they are observing, as well as learn more about the beautiful Mexican culture, its history and
    most common legends.{' '}
  </li>
  <li>
    {' '}
    Provide places where they can eat without suffering from any infection, and if it is possible that
    they speak English.
  </li>
  <li> Give the level of security that is around that place.</li>
  <li> Tips and important recommendations for visiting Mexico.</li>
</ol>

# Future ideas

To be the most complete agency for foreign tourists so that they can come without complications, safe, with the most complete and accessible information so that it is the best vacation they have. You have the following ideas:

<details>
  <summary>**NFTs**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Acquisition of the service. Sell service tickets in NFT format, so as not to create physical tickets,
      count who are the people who have requested it. If for some reason you can't go or want to sell
      it, you can.{' '}
    </li>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Official tokens of archaeological zones or collections of important people. If you have the digital
      asset in your wallet, you will be able to access the ruins at no cost. In addition, you will be
      able to integrate your NFT to the Metaverse and show that you own or live in one of these pyramids.{' '}
      <u>
        Agreements are needed with the government and the INAH (National Institute of Anthropology
        and History) to release an official collection
      </u>.{' '}
    </li>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Discount tokens in establishments or make a NYC pass type. With these tokens, if you own them,
      you can get discounts on trips, flights, hotels, associated restaurants. They also make passes
      so you can access various attractions for a reduced price in packages.{' '}
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**AI**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      **Take a specialized route.** You can create an account on the site, logging in through your
      digital asset (passwordless authentication). There, you will be asked questions in two ways,
      if you want the AI to choose based on your tastes or to tell us a little more. In both cases,
      you will also be asked what places you plan to visit, but take the interactive map.
    </li>
    <li>The topics to ask are: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit of archaeological ruins (Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan)</li>
      <li>Visit of Magic Towns (Cuetzalan, El Oro, Oaxaca capital)</li>
      <li>Food tasting (Tacos, chocolate, pozole, chile en Nogada, etc).</li>
      <li>Tasting of alcoholic beverages (Beer, Mezcal, Tequila, Wine)</li>
      <li>Learn about culture (Mainly museums)</li>
      <li>
        Go to events or festivities (Guelaguetza, concerts like EDC, Formula 1, Day of the Dead,
        etc.)
      </li>
      <li>Climate (Cold or heat). Recommendations for beaches or forests.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      By having these two elements (questionnaire and places), a specialized guide will be made, in
      the language of the tourist, with the planning and places to visit, either by recommendation
      or by personal interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Reservations.** When continuing, he will be asked if he wants to show a preview of the
      flights, hotels, packages that he will use in his visit to Mexico, one by one, so that he can
      check them. He will be able to specify them one by one or all equally with a button. The
      collaboration and integration of third parties in tourist services is needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Provide the necessary information you need according to the places you visit.** When I
      arrived in Mexico, you can start to see your visit itinerary, with the routes, transportation
      you need to take, as well as if there is an alert if you will go through a place that is not
      so safe.
    </li>
    <li>
      Analyze the information with Machine Learning to find out where the tourists come from, to
      improve the service and prepare the guides with their own vocabulary from their country and
      have a better experience.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Interactive Maps of Mexico**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Landing page improvements will be applied so you can watch a couple of videos with the best destinations.
      At the moment of logging you will see a map that by means of a hover or a touch of the screen will
      expand the state of the country, it will display the best destinations in a list with photos.{' '}
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Include different languages**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Your location will be obtained, but you will still be able to change the language.{' '}
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Mobile and desktop applications**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      Currently there is only one Web App. In both cases, complete infographics can be displayed (both
      written and in audio format), depending on the language and offline so that they can be in the
      place and understand what they are seeing without any problem.{' '}
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Creation of Communities**:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">
      {' '}
      As if that were not enough and if they do not trust our service, they will have access to communities
      for free on Discord so that they can discuss among themselves in different languages (segmented
      channels). This is also useful for amaxing because you can update information or tips without constantly
      going to places.{' '}
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

# Beneficiaries

    1. **Foreign tourists.** Tourists will be able to enjoy all the benefits listed above, drastically improving their stay in Mexico, recommending both the destination and the service to family and friends.
    2. **Population in Mexico.** Priority will be given to the population with fewer opportunities to benefit from tourism, providing English courses to establish communication with tourists and taste better dishes or places. In general, the fact of promoting and improving tourism is already a great impact that will be had.
