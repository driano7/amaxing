# It is well known and has the stigma

by foreign tourists that Mexico is a `dangerous` country and that drug trafficking is deeply rooted in the country, but
that is more present in the north, in the states and cities that confront the United States. In Mexico City it is not very present, ergo if there is an important
level of `crime` such as `assaults` or `robberies`.

Next, I put at your disposal a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/edit?mid=1zMG4-8m546d9jPT_PW1d8WVbQKHs4D8&ll=22.94799757634138%2C-102.552784&z=5) with the neighborhoods with the most impact on crimes so that you avoid going through them. However, I do recommend that you
always keep an eye on your belongings, as well as when using public transport where there are many "pickpockets" in the metro system when this
it is very crowded (mainly they deal with cell phone theft).

If a mishap happens to you, you have the [emergency numbers](/blog/Info/phones) at your disposal or if you are in a tourist place, go to
to a [police](/blog/Info/policies) who can help you.
