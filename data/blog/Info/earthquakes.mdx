# Mexico is a country that has different plates that collide with each other causing earthquakes.

Mexico has suffered great mishaps, among which the one in [1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Mexico_City_earthquake), the one on September 19, [2017](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/19/americas/mexico-earthquake/index.html) and recently one was presented on September 19 of this [year](https://weather.com/news/news/2022-09-22-mexico-earthquake-aftershock-mexico-city-michoacan).

According to the recommendations of the government itself, this is what should be done before, during and after an `earthquake`:

## Before

1. Locate objects that may become a hazard during an earthquake.
2. Relocate targets so that they do not fall on top of a person in the event of an earthquake.
3. Locate escape and safety areas and keep them always present.
4. Always have at hand a first aid kit, flashlight, battery-powered radio, canned food
5. Have a copy of important official documents.

## During

1. Stay calm, do not run and go to the already established safety zones.
2. Be attentive to children, disabled and elderly people.
3. Stay away from windows, glass, mirrors, exterior doors, or walls.
4. At the street: stay away from electric poles and wires.
5. In a building: Do not use the elevators and stay near a structural column, away from windows and walls.
6. Inside a crowded place like a movie theater, go toward the evacuation doors.
7. Stay away from shelves that contain objects that could fall on you.
8. If you are driving: Stop as quickly as possible and stay inside the vehicle.
9. If you are in a building with more than 4 floors, it is recommended that you do not try to descend for the time it takes, it is best to retreat to the walls or in a safe space

## After

1. Please wait at least 10-20 minutes before entering your home or workplace.
2. Inspect your home for damage and turn off the gas and electrical system.
3. If the power goes out, use battery-powered flashlights. Do not use candles or matches and do not smoke indoors.
4. Cooperate with the authorities and remember to have emergency numbers handy.
5. Always be in solidarity with the victims of the accidents.
