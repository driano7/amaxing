# In the most touristic areas of Mexico City

you can find `police officers` who can help you with confidence and who speak `different languages`, among which the following stand out: - English - French - Italian - _Nahuatl_ (native language of Mexico) - _Totonaca_ (native language of Mexico)

These police officers wear a sand-colored uniform (boots, pants, bulletproof vest)
and a light blue shirt. The Tourist Police, has assistance training and at the
same time with the necessary knowledge for the protection, security and care of tourists.
The areas where they are commonly found are:

    1. Historic Center (next to the Zocalo, the Palace of Fine Arts and the Alameda Central Park)
    2. Paseo de la Reforma, the monument to the Angel of Independence and the monument to the Revolution
    3. In the center of Coyoacán, as well as in the nearby museums of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.
    4. At the Xochimilco pier
    5. The surroundings of the Polanco area, such as Lincoln Park

One day when I was at the Frida Kahlo museum, I found a patrol, which the officers were so kind and gave me
a couple of observations to consider:

    - i) A tourist is considered to be from anywhere outside of Mexico City, regardless of the adjoining state
    - ii) They speak Spanish and another language, in general English, and there are colleagues who even speak Chinese
    - iii) If when you are for your stay in Mexico City, if an agency, hotel or business charges you more, if in your hotel, airline or on the road
      If your suitcase or your belongings are stolen by public authorities, they will support you from the inconvenience until you leave the city or the country. Help you with tracking
      and demand.
    - iv) There is an app called ["Mi Policia"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moobky.MyPolice) that allows you to just contact them if you have an [emergency]( /blog/Info/phones), the button is similar to a camera, and it gives me on the phone that it is from the application.
      This cell phone is a WhatsApp group number where you put your emergency and a unit is at your disposal to help you, trying to find a person who speaks
      That language. The cell phone is +52 5548911116
