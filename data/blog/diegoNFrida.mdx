# The story of Diego and Frida

`Frida Kahlo` and `Diego Rivera` have an age difference of almost 20 years. Diego Rivera, a famous painter who, thanks to his cubist art and his murals of the Mexican revolution, led him to share spaces like Picasso. While, Frida Kahlo,
she learned from photography that her father instilled in her, being a great background for her to be able to paint after her accident on the train at the age of 18. It should be noted that Diego ended one marriage and started another.

Diego fell in love with Frida because of her talent and the emotions that he captured in her paintings, getting married when Frida was 22 years old. It was a relationship with a lot of passion and torture, since both were geniuses and artists,
committed to social and political revolutions, their works and their lives are marked by the symbiosis between the two. For this reason, it creates such a stir, and they are so famous worldwide.
