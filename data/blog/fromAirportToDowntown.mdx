# It's a complicated and big city, sometimes more than NYC

Unlike large cities, the airport is located on the edge of the City but within it, so it is relatively close to the center, but remember that it is one of the cities with the most population and, above all, the most traffic worldwide.
With this in mind, you will see that public transport, and especially the subway, will be your best ally, besides, it is not as complicated, dirty and dangerous as New York. Of course, the policemen inside it do not speak English.

# Among the options to get to the center are:

- Metrobus (MB)
- Metro Form 1. As the line that communicates directly with the center does not work right now, you will have to reroute through line 9 (coffee, a bit complicated)
- Metro Form 2. Line 1 (pink) is the fastest route but it is under maintenance.
- Uber

Next, I will give you more detail about each of them (<u>**click every below item to see details**</u>):

    <li> Congratulations, you'll upload them and you've reached subway line 9 (brown). Yes it is complicated
      but not like NYC. </li>
    <li> From there there are 7 stations, you will get off at the `Chabacano` station. Keep in mind that
      the metro is usually very, very crowded, and sometimes it is delayed or stopped, welcome to Mexico
      City. If there are no setbacks, it will take 10 to 15 minutes. You will exit through the doors
      that usually open first, and follow the signs for subway line 2 (indigo blue). </li>

  <ul>
    <li type="square"> This is clearly the simplest way. In fact, the application service is very cheap. It can cost you
      around 7 to 10 dls depending on the traffic and the time.</li>
    <li type="square"> Only, do it away from gate 1, either on `Circuito interior` avenue (in front of the subway entrance,
      instructions on form 2) or gate 5 onwards, because yellow taxis are expensive and have preference
      against application services. So many coincidences with NYC. </li>
